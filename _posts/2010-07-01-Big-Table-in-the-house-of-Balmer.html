<p>The Boston Chapter of NoSQL Summer kicks off tonight at <a href="http://microsoftcambridge.com/Events/NoSQLSummer/tabid/450/Default.aspx">Microsoft's New England Research &amp; Development Center.</a> (A Big thanks needs to be given to <a href="http://twitter.com/matthewpodwysocki"> Matthew Podwysocki</a> and Leah Brunson for helping to lock down the meeting space for the summer.) <a href="http://basho.com">Basho</a>, with some help from <a href="http://twitter.com/steadicat">Stefano</a>&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a href="https://cloudant.com">Cloudant</a>, took the reins and helped get this meeting off the ground, and after missing week one, we have about 20 onlookers queued up to attend tonight.</p>

<p><a href="http://nosqlsummer.org/">NoSQL Summer,</a> the brain child of the g&eacute;nial <a href="%22http://twitter.com/timanglade">Tim Anglade,</a> is billed as a "seasonal, worldwide reading club for databases, distributed systems &amp; NOSQL-related scientific papers." What started as a 10 city experiment intended to bring a few curious developers and technologists up to speed with NoSQL Technologies has, in less than two months time, blown up into a global weekly meeting of the minds, currently comprised of almost participants in 31 cities on four continents. Awesome, to say the least!</p>

<p>The inaugural Boston meeting will be lead by Daniel Einspanjer, a developer for Mozilla who has production experience with a whole host of databases. He is currently involved with production installations of (at the very least) <a href="http://hbase.apache.org/">Hbase</a> and <a href="http://wiki.basho.com">Riak.</a> Tonight's meeting with cover <a href="http://nosqlsummer.org/paper/google-bigtable">Google's Big Table Paper</a>, the publication after which Hbase is modeled. Daniel has some serious NoSQL chops, so we are all looking forward to him dropping some theoretical and production knowledge on us. (If anyone in the Boston area wants to join us for next week, <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/nosql-summer-boston">register for the local mailing list</a> to get involved.)</p>

<p>Aside from educating the masses, the goal of the NoSQL Summer meetings is to annotate the papers being discussed. So, with any luck, some usable notes and insights will emerge from tonight's meeting. Stay tuned for those and other anecdotes from what will hopefully be the first of many insightful and worthwhile meetings here in Boston this summer. Who knows, perhaps Ballmer himself will make an appearance; he does have all this free time on his hands now that <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5576764/microsoft-kills-kin">the Kin is no more...</a></p>
