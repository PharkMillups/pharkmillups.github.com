<p>As community manager for various open source projects at <a href="http://www.basho.com">Basho</a>, I spend a lot of time thinking about community growth. Questions like "How fast is <a href="wiki.basho.com">Riak</a> growing compared to similar projects in the space?" and "What metrics should be weighted more when calculating growth rates?" keep me up at night (no joke).</p>
<p>Lately I've been thinking about how to best use the various stats that are easily gleaned from <a href="github.com">GitHub</a> repositories (which is the canonical home for <a href="http://github.com/basho">all of Basho's code</a>). Among the available repo-specific metrics are the number of "Watchers" and the number of "Forks." I keep an eye on these two stats quite compulsively and record their ups and downs on a weekly basis. (You can see a list of the most watched GitHub repositories <a href="https://github.com/popular/watched">here</a> and a list of the most forked repositories <a href="https://github.com/popular/forked">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Forks are much easier to use than Watchers when talking about growth; though what it means to "fork" a project has changed drastically over the past several years, when someone forks your code it implies, among other things, that they intend to spend time working with and on it (and perhaps even contribute!). But what about Watchers? What does it mean when one starts watching a repo? What level of commitment does it take to start watching a repo and what does that mean for the growth of said project? Without a doubt Watcher growth is analogous to popularity growth, but what does that mean for community growth (read: <strong>actual use and participation in development</strong>)?</p>
<p>I poked around a bit (and even talked to a friend at GitHub briefly) but couldn't seem to find any data or explanation around why or what causes people to start watching repos on GH. So, I threw together this simple survey (<strong><em>scroll down</em></strong>) for anyone who is using GitHub and/or BitBucket. (BitBucket also displays Forks and has the concept of "Followers" which I take to be analogous to Watchers.)</p>
<p>I understand there is some overlap between "When" and "Why", but I though it worthwhile to ask them both anyways.</p>
<p>Thanks for your participation. I should take you all of 30 seconds...</p>
