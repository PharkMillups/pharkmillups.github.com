title: What's Missing in the NoSQL Space
---

<p class="date">December 08, 2010</p>

<p>The NoSQL space is awash in commentary and publications. <a href="http://www.nosqlweekly.com/">Seriously</a>, <a href="http://www.nosqldatabases.com/">it's</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://nosql.mypopescu.com/">getting</a> <a href="http://nosqlpedia.com/">crowded.</a> This is a very good thing. It means that there is enough interest and usage of these technologies to necessitate regular reporting. However, it's time to take this coverage a bit deeper.</p>
<p>We need to close the gap between very high-level (and sometimes "sponsored") blog posts, NoSQL Wikis, and immensely-valuable but dense academic papers. Without a doubt they all have their place, but result in a lot of valuable knowledge going unaddressed. Most developers can either rattle off the buzzwords and newest features or can recite the code and design principles verbatim (and those that fall into the latter category are few and far between). What's worse is that a lot of times how a database works is misunderstood until it's too late and something breaks in production, something that could have been prevented with more knowledge of how a given DB is supposed to function.</p>
<p><strong>So What's Missing?</strong></p>
<p>Highly-technical, side-by-side behavior comparisons. Start writing about what is happening under the hood of each of these DBs and how they stack up in relation to their peers. For example, it's easy to say, "CouchDB uses MVCC for versioning whereas Riak uses vector clocks" but what does that mean in practice and how could that affect your query pattern under load?</p>
<p><em><strong>Here are some more examples:</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>1. Data Distribution and Replication</strong></p>
<p>Riak, Cassandra and Voldemort are often categorized as "Dynamo Clones." Many people cite simple, built-in replication and masterless data distribution as the distinguishing features for this class of NoSQL DBs. But they each do it differently and build in various control mechanisms. Put the different approaches and design principles side-by-side for all these databases and walk your readers through what happens when data is written, read, or deleted in an X node cluster. What happens when you bring up or take down a new server?  Redis, MongoDB and others all have their own approach to data distribution. What does their code say will happen? How should you plan for this?</p>
<p><strong>2. MapReduce and Other Querying</strong></p>
<p>Riak, MongoDB, CouchDB and others push MapReduce as a query method. And, not surprisingly, they all do it differently. Put their MapReduce implementations side-by-side and walk readers through what it is and how it can be used. And be sure to compare it to Hadoop's MapReduce. This differentiation is a biggie.</p>
<p><strong>3. Data Durability</strong></p>
<p>Databases should offer you some guarantee that, once written, your data will persist to something (preferably a disk) and be safe and free of corruption in the event of failures. Write an overview of how each database handles durability and how this might impact your choice. Is each database even built for durable writes out of the box? What are the backend storage options and what are their pros and cons?</p>
<p><strong>4. Data Versioning and Consistency</strong></p>
<p>What mechanisms are there in each database for version control? Riak uses vector clocks. CouchDB uses MVCC. MongoDB "is more of a traditional update-in-place store." Examine the code from each database that handles versioning and give some details on how this should be accounted for in applications.</p>
<p><strong>5. Interfaces, APIs and Data Formats</strong></p>
<p>Cassandra employs Thrift. Riak uses both HTTP and Protocol Buffers for APIs. MongoDB uses a Wire Protocol and BSON. The list goes on and on. Write a post that compares API design. Talk about what different data formats each DB will store and how that will impact your application design. How mature is the client code for a given language? What is the state of the documentation for their respective clients?</p>
<p><strong>6. Operations</strong></p>
<p>How easy is it to back up and restore a node? Does each DB even offer this functionality? Is there support for backing up an entire cluster? Is there a full-fledged and robust suite of command line tools? How easy is it to add storage capacity? Or reduce cluster size to save money when running on Amazon or Rackspace? What are the "gotchas"? And, once again, how should you plan for the state of this functionality in your application?</p>
<p>And this list is just a start. (This took me about 10 minutes of thinking to compile). <strong><em>Also, huge bonus points will be awarded and traffic spikes will occur if you take the time to include MySQL and/or PostgreSQL.</em></strong></p>
<p>The bottom line is that these databases are maturing quickly and any developer worth their salt should now be in favor of the right tool for the job (and if you're still on the fence about putting something called "Redis" or "CouchDB" into production, you may want to reconsider your approach to selecting tools as you're missing out on some awesome technology that's solving real problems). These tool-hungry developers need a person or group of persons (that are not vendors or paid by vendors) to deliver deep technical commentary on a regular basis to help them make informed decisions about what DBs to test and deploy. You could be this person.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, there is <strong>absolutely</strong> no substitute for real testing. Test, retest, break something, and then test again. But technical writing that delves into behavioral comparisons for DB X, Y and Z according to the code and sanctioned documentation would save developers scores of time when researching and serve to educate the masses.</p>
<p>If you take on this task, your blog/newsletter/website will be inundated with visitors, conference organizers everywhere will ask you to moderate panels, and developers, CTOs, VPs of Engineering (and maybe even analysts) everywhere will bookmark your posts. Most importantly, I will hug you. Actually, the only thing I can guarantee is that I will hug you, but this is undoubtedly a great opportunity to establish yourself as a technical authority on NoSQL DBs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any takers?&nbsp;</p>
