title: What I Learned From Organizing The First Riak Meetup
---

<p class="date">August 20, 2010</p>
<p>A Community Manager for an open source project has a laundry-list lot of responsibilities ("wears a lot of hats," if you will), and this list only gets longer when you work at a startup. Recently, I had the opportunity to try my hand at event planning. As some of you might have known, Basho just organized and held the first&nbsp;<a href="http://www.meetup.com/San-Francisco-Riak-Meetup/">Riak San Francisco Meetup</a> which was originally <a href="http://blog.basho.com/2010/07/19/basho-west-and-the-riak-one-year-anniversary/">announced on the Basho Blog.</a> It was very well-attended (drawing more than 100 people), the presentations and talks were informative and valuable, and the caliber of Riak (and non-Riak) discussion was exceptional. All told, I would argue it was a huge success.</p>
<p>I had never planned an event of this size before, so I had to figure out how to do it on the fly. What I learned was that, while it's nowhere near as complex and challenging as writing a distributed database in Erlang, it does take some considerable time, effort, and precision.</p>
<p>If you read my last post entitled <a href="http://phark.posterous.com/why-i-write-the-riak-recap-everyday">Why I Write the Riak Recap Every Day</a>, you may recall that I deal in what I consider to be mainly commonsense and simple but useful insights and advice. This post falls into that category. Hopefully those looking to plan an event can learn from this and perhaps offer some tips and tricks that I might have overlooked.</p>
<p><strong>Goals and Vision:</strong></p>
<p>First things first: What's the point of the event and what are you trying to accomplish? For me, it was initially about starting a monthly Riak developer meetup. The significance quickly grew when we decided to make it also about our arrival in San Francisco and the one-year anniversary of Riak being open-sourced. So, our vision and goals became two-fold:</p>
<ol>
<li>Establish a monthly Riak developer meetup to educate, promote, and exchange ideas</li>
<li>Show developers, technologists, and executives that Riak is a rock-solid project with a strong community growing around it. People should leave with a firm understanding of what Riak is, who is using it, and why they should want to get involved.</li>
</ol>
<p>You should have have a well-articulated vision for the event. It doesn't have to be a novel. A few lines will do. Once you know the point of the meetup or event, you can then set about planning appropriately.</p>
<p><strong>Organization</strong></p>
<p>To actually organize the event and track attendance and RSVPs, I chose <a href="http://meetup.com">Meetup</a>. The price for hosting the page for six months was cheap, and that was before the 50% discount I received. (Try this: go through the motions to set up your group's page and then leave the site before actually buying anything. I did this accidentally and then happened to receive an email a day later saying, "Hey, we noticed you almost bought something. Would 50% off make it worth your while?" Not sure if it's an automated email but it might be worth a try.)</p>
<p>Why did I choose it? No real reason except that it was cheap, and, to be honest, the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/San-Francisco-Redis-Meetup/"> Redis Meetup</a> looked like it was quite successful, so I figured it wasn't a bad model from which to borrow. I spoke with a few people who weren't too psyched about using the site for organizing the meetup, but I think I'll stick with it. The "Review" and "Ideas" features have already proven useful, too, and I'm looking forward to seeing more out of these as we start to hold more meetings.</p>
<p><strong>Location</strong></p>
<p>In San Francisco, there is no shortage of rentable spaces to accommodate a developer event. After some exploration and deliberation (using Yelp to start things off), I ended up choosing the <a href="http://www.111minnagallery.com/">111 Minna Gallery.</a> In addition to being a highly-regarded, non-traditional venue, it made sense based on our attendance target and vision/goals.</p>
<p>Was it expensive? Yes and no. If you need a turnkey event space (complete with bar, bartenders, security, sound system, coat check, etc.) then yes. But there are cheaper options in the SOMA area if you're looking to do something on a smaller, less expensive scale. (For future Riak meetups I'll probably look into renting out <a href="http://citizenspace.us/">Citizen Space</a>.) That said, if you can afford it and need the space, definitely consider 111 Minna. It exceeds its reputation.</p>
<p><strong>Food and Drink</strong></p>
<p>Enlisting the services of a caterer was crucial for us. There is no way we were going to furnish food for more than 100 people without the help of some professionals. We also wanted to impress our guests, and my cooking was not going to help Basho's reputation.</p>
<p>I jumped on Yelp, made a list of 10 potential vendors based on reviews and location, and started soliciting estimates based on my requirements. Most vendors were quick to respond with prices and sample menus.  As expected, there was a huge variance in prices proposed, so you'll have to look around a bit to find someone that suits your budget. In the end, I chose a company called <a href="http://www.forkandspoonproductions.com/index_flash.htm">Fork &amp; Spoon.</a>&nbsp;If you can forgive them for their heavy Flash usage and the auto-play music, I would highly recommend them. The food quality and quantity were amazing, and the level of customization was top notch. I worked with Clementine Berk, Director of Corporate Events, who was more than happy to accommodate multiple requests and was excellent&nbsp;overall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Pro Tip: Don't forget the vegans. This should go without saying, but have at least one vegan item available.(We had two.)</em></p>
<p>As for providing drinks, if the venue permits, you should have a cash bar at the very least. Basho decided to go all out and provide an open bar, which (not surprisingly) was a huge hit. If you can afford it, buy the bar.</p>
<p><strong>Small Details</strong></p>
<p>The "Small Details" category will expand as your get further into planning and more needs present themselves. Here are a few that I encountered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Projector: If you need one, make sure it's present. And show up and test it before the meeting happens. Make sure the actual projection fits on the screen and adjust in advance as necessary.</li>
<li>Dongles and connectors: Talk to all your presenters and find out what type of laptop they will be using and have an array of dongles available (even if they are planning to bring them). Another way to do this is to have a dedicated, pre-tested laptop and have all presenters send their slides over in advance.</li>
<li>Name Tags: I totally overlooked this detail and would have forgotten had I not been texted by a coworker 35 minutes before the event was to start. To avoid an eleventh hour sprint to Office Depot, grab a bunch of name tags and some Sharpies far in advance.</li>
<li>Music: The Riak meetup was a two hour event, with about 60 minutes scheduled for talks and Q and A. For the other 60 minutes, I threw together a playlist that was played at low volume to keep things lively while people were chatting.</li>
<li>Wifi: Make sure it's available (if you need it) and do your best to ensure the network name and password are visible.</li>
<li>Photos: Definitely worthwhile having a photographer if you can afford it. And it's even more worthwhile if you happen to know a kick-ass photographer who is willing to attend and take photos for free. (Chances are that you know someone who can do it for you. We summoned the powers of the inimitable <a href="http://twitter.com/kirindave">@kirindave</a> Make friends with him. He's quite talented!) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>General Tips, Tricks and Regrets</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Budget is key. Establish this first and make all decisions based on what you can spend. You can plan all you want, but if you book the <a href="http://www.moscone.com/"> Moscone Center</a> only to realize you can't afford it, you've wasted time and effort.</li>
<li>Ask for discounts. We are a startup and are on a tight budget. If you're in the same situation (or are at all frugal), it's more than reasonable to ask for a discount. I'm not advocating asking for a 50% reduction in price. That's just being an ass. But, something in the 10% area in exchange for making them the preferred vendor for future events is fair and mutually advantageous.</li>
<li>The only thing I regret is not filming the talks. I have to admit that I almost totally overlooked this, and when I realized I should be video taping the proceedings for posterity, it was too late. There was also considerable interest in it being streamed live online. I'll be looking into this for the next installment of the meetup, too.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Based on Basho and Riak&rsquo;s current trajectory, I don&rsquo;t suspect it will be too long before we have the opportunity to plan an event of this size and importance again. This is exciting because, though stressful, it was an amazing learning experience and I have no doubt that we can do it better and more efficiently. The next Riak-related meetup I will have a hand in planning will be next month&rsquo;s Riak Meetup in San Francico (details to be announced soon), and you should <a href="http://www.meetup.com/San-Francisco-Riak-Meetup/">join the group</a> if haven&rsquo;t done so already.</p>
<p>Meetups are essential to the success of any project. Attendees (especially those from the VC and C-level ranks, of whom there were numerous at the Riak Meetup) will note not only the quality of your software, but also the way you organize and execute events. It pays to do it well.</p>
