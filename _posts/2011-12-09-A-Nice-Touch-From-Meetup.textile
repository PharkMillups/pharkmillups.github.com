title: A Nice Touch From Meetup.com

I spent yesterday and today setting up and announcing a new meetup we are getting off the ground called "BashoChats":http://www.meetup.com/BashoChats/events/43849732. The purpose of BashoChats is to help build out the distributed systems and large-scale computing community in and around they Bay Area. "Basho":http://basho.com is deeply invested in the future of distributed systems in practice, and, along with companies like Boundary, (who, admittedly, "gave me the idea to start BashoChats":http://www.meetup.com/Boundary-Tech-Talks/), I have to say the future is looking bright for bringing what has been, to date, a largely academic pursuit into the lives of more developers. 

When I was setting up the group's meetup page something stuck out to me that I had missed in my previous interactions with the "Group Creation Page":http://www.meetup.com/create. Check this out:

Right before you sign off on creating your new group, Meetup.com prompts you to check a box that confirms you intend to "create real, face-to-face community." This is a small feature, and I'm sure a lot of people who check this box don't think twice about it. (Up until yesterday this group included me.) But, having seen it, I think it's worthy of highlighting. Is it "corny"? Sure, a bit, but how cares? In my opinion some of the most-valuable community building blocks can be categorized as such. (For example, I've heard "this talk":http://jsconf.eu/2011/an_end_to_negativity.html from Chris Williams called corny on more than one occasion, to which I always respond: "Sure, but watch it again and tell me you don't feel just a tiny bit motivated about building positive communities.")  

This small check box certainly had an impact on me. Coming from a person who spends most of their time thinking about how to get people more committed and passionate about the idea "community", I thought this was, well, a nice touch.
