<p>A few weeks ago I dashed off a post called "<a href="http://www.themarkphillips.com/2011/01/20/Why-Do-People-Watch-Code.html">Why Do People "Watch" Code? A Short Survey For Open Source Developers</a>." I had been spending some time attempting to pin down the significance of GitHub Watchers. Specifically, I was 	struggling with how much emphasis should be put on the increase (or decrease) in project watchers when attempting to calculate the growth of <a href="http://wiki.basho.com">Riak's</a> open source community.</p>
<p>Instead of guessing, I resolved to ask developers two simple questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>When do you typically start Watching/Following a repo?</li>
<li>Why do you choose to start Watching/Following a given repo?</li>
</ol>
<p>At the time of publishing this post, I have received exactly 400 responses[1]. This is not an insignificant number and I take this to be an adequate sample size to draw a few conclusions. So, what did I find?</p>
<h3>1. When do you typically start Watching/Following a repo?</h3>

<p>The responses to "When do you start watching?" are more or less in line with what I suspected. The overwhelming majority of people (78%)&nbsp;watch a repo when they are "interested." A good portion of this 78%  will probably come back to it and test drive the code when they have free time or actual use for it. But maybe they won't. In other words, <em>Have Interest, Will Watch.</em></p>
<p>6% of people surveyed said they only watch when they are using something in production. That's a small number, but it's still useful. For example, in the case of <a href="https://github.com/ry/node">node.js</a>, we can say that, based on people using GitHub alone, at least 277 people/organizations are running node.js in production somewhere. That number undoubtedly gets significantly larger when you take into account the approximately 463 people (or 10% based on the survey results) who started watching when they cloned the repo to start experimenting. (There will also be more production users who come from the "Interest" and "Fork" constituencies.)</p>
<p>The "Why" responses are a bit more interesting, if only because participants had the ability to select multiple reasons. Again, "interest" takes the top spot, but we also see that people are watching a lot of times because they like the author's code (47% of total respondents). 56 people (or 15%) checked off "Other" as a reason for why they watch a repo. Nearly 20 of these involved using the watcher feature as a "bookmark" (with at least one person even equating it to Delicious).</p>
<h2>What do these numbers mean for community growth?</h2>
<p>It would appear that for community managers the "watchers" metric should be treated primarily as a sign of increased interest and popularity. Developers largely use it to bookmark projects in which they are interested. And perhaps that's what our social coding overlords at GitHub wanted it to be. (If that's the case, then it's a wonderful feature.) I have no doubt that an increase in watchers means an increase in users, but only 6% of people surveyed hold out until production usage to start watching. The path from interest to cloning to production usage is a complex one, &nbsp;and knowing how many watchers convert to users (and potentially contribute to a project's community) is something that's extremely hard to pin down. I'll continue to keep an eye on Watchers, but I won't treat it as a primary indicator of community growth.</p>
<p>Here's my advice to you, GitHub: make it easier for developers to declare that they are using code in production. Sure, this is for my own selfish community manager-centric needs, but other people will find it valuable, too. This might be as simple as just adding a "Production User" option to the right of "Watcher" and "Fork" buttons. Or maybe it's more complex than that. However you implement it, I think it would be a fantastic addition...</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who participated. I found this data immensely valuable. I hope you did, too.</p>
