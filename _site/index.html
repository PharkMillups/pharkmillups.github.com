			<li class="summary"><p> I spent yesterday and today setting up and announcing a new meetup we are getting off the ground called BashoChats. The purpose of BashoChats is to help build out the distributed systems community in and around they Bay Area. Basho is deeply invested in the future of distributed systems in practice, and along with companies like Boundary, (who, I have to admit, gave me the idea to start BashoChats), I have to say the future is looking bright for bringing what has been, to date, a largely academic pursuit into the lives of more developers ...</p></li>

It pains me when questions or issue goes unanswered. Developers have too many choices for solid, functional open offerings these days in just about every part of their stack for us not to value their participation and usage, and for a community to not be responsive means they run the risk of losing newcomers and existing users ...</li>
